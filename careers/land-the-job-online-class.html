        <h2 class="major">Are you exhausted from a job search that feels random?</h2>
        <p>I hear you.</p>

        <p>It can feel soul-crushing to try and do everything right with your resume and portfolio and still not get an offer you want.</p>

        <p>Especially if you see posts everywhere of people landing incredible jobs who don't do anything different than you.</p>

        <p>
            The truth is that the entire interviewing process in our industry is broken and geared to keep people out instead of recognizing your talents
            and ability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Think about it! First, you send a resume and hope someone gleans from that single paper that you're worth interviewing. Then when you interview
            have to answer obscure trick questions, code problems you'll never solve on the job, with tools you'll never use, and do it all within a few minutes.
            Nothing about that is fair or shows them how great you could be at the job. It just sets you up to fail.
        </p>

        <p><b>But what if you knew how to write a resume that gets you an interview every time? What if you knew how to reverse the odds when you went into the interview so that you had the upper hand? What if you negotiated more compensation every time?</b></p>

        <p>You absolutely can, just like my clients.</p>

        <p>I have helped developers with negotiation and compensation <b>exceeding a million dollars.</b></p>

        <blockquote>
            "When I first started my job search I used freely available online materials to prepare for interviews. I spent hours reading information on how to prepare but it all felt overwhelming and disorganized. A friend referred me to Ryan after having worked with Ryan for a couple of months and successfully landed a coveted role at a unicorn tech company. Right from early conversations with Ryan, I felt like he understood what I was going through and was able to help me navigate the complicated process of preparing for interviews with top tech companies."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here's a secret&mdash;the skills and knowledge needed to get a job have <b>NOTHING</b> to do with doing the job itself.</p>

        <p>
            If you want to have the career and job you want, learn the skills and knowledge needed to get offers on your terms! There is hope in this idea.
            It means that you can get the jobs you want by picking up a few more skills. It isn't about your coding ability at all!
        </p>

        <p>Most of what people believe about getting a job comes from our parents or what we hear from our peers. Sadly, what worked for them may not work consistently. That means that you might be copying advice that only worked one time, or you might be trying to duplicate something that was luck.</p>

        <p>My approach is different. I tracked metrics across numerous experiments over a decade of job-hopping.  I interviewed and surveyed hiring managers, and incorporated feedback from my career clients.</p>

        <p><b>What I teach comes with a guarantee because it works.</b></p>

        <p>When you know that you can get a job when you want, you have freedom and power in your career. You don't have to suffer under a toxic manager or stagnate in a job without growth. Instead, you can apply what I teach and find that next, better, more profitable opportunity.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I recently worked with Ryan in preparation for a final round interview for a technical program manager position. Ryan is a terrific coach and mentor who spent as much time as I needed to feel confident and prepared for the interview. He provided me with a foundation and framework for the system design interview that ultimately helped me land an offer that I was ecstatic about. I would recommend Ryan to anyone seeking to improve their skills ahead of a technical interview."
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>This is how to get the career you want for the lifestyle you deserve.</b></p>

        <h2 class="major">Proven Material That Gets Results</h2>
        <p>Okay, so the self paced-class is {{page.price}}, and that probably comes with a bit of sticker shock. If you put what I teach
        into action, not only will you get a job faster, but you can negotiate $10,000. That is a 10:1 return on only what I teach to negotiate.
        If you consider more broadly that this material will help you throughout your career, this material is worth millions in the career
        that you can have.</p>

        <p>Yeah, yeah, so what do you actually get? Let me explain the overall course structure. The class is 31 focused videos spread across 20 lessons.
        Let me break down the material:</p>

        <h3>Introduction & Onboarding - 3 Lessons</h3>
        <p>These lessons orient you to the course and prepare you to make the most of its material. You also will develop personal goals for both
        your life and career, and get a better sense of who you really want to be in that career. These elements will give you a clear direction
        in your job search, interviews, and negotiation.</p>

        <h3>Six-Figure Resume - 4 Lessons</h3>
        <p>I know nobody really loves dealing with their resume, but it is required for every job we want. When you're done with these
        lessons you'll have a resume that will have a dramatic increase in the number of interviews you get.</p>

        <h3>Other Materials &amp; Applying to Jobs - 5 Lessons</h3>
        <p>Some of you are already thinking, "What about my portfolio site or github?" These lessons will tell you how to get the most out of
        these other materials so that you don't waste a bunch of precious time. This lesson also introduces the overall system I teach people
        to use to get a job quickly. For first-time people, you can have a job in less than six months. For people with six months of experience or more, you
        can get a job in less than three months. 

        <p>The shortest time I've seen is two weeks. <b>Can you beat that?</b></p>

        <h3>Nailing Interviews - 7 lessons</h3>
        <p>Okay, this is the big one. These lessons break down the overall process that interviews fall into, introduce strategies that work across all of them, and then tear down specific interviews and how to deal with them.</p>

        <p>For example, everyone will get hit with a question they don't know the answer two, but I teach three different ways to handle that. When you have to
        do an assignment, I'll teach you how to do it so that you stand out from everyone else, and a few other secrets.</p>

        <p>The list goes on, but I want to be clear. I do not teach you how to code, or the answers to questions like, "How do you explain prototypical inheritance in javascript?"
        I teach you how to beat these interviews <b>regardless</b> of what they ask you.</p>

        <h3>Offers and Negotiation - 4 lessons</h3>
        <p>Here at the end, I teach you how to safely negotiate every offer you're going to see and a few higher-risk ways to negotiate as well. You'll also learn what is in your offer packet, what to ask about, and what to watch out for. Finally, I'll teach you how to handle a job search when you're already employed. At the end of this lesson, you'll be ready to sign the offer you want.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Over the past several years Ryan has been a constant source of information for me in my development career. Ryan's mentorship put me in a headspace to focus on the right things to not only get the job I want, but to do well in it. 3 months ago I landed a dream job working on a product that I had already used and loved for the better part of a decade with a salary that I would have laughed at if you told me five years ago. It would be an understatement to say that I worked hard for all of this, but it is also completely true that none of this would have been possible without the ways that Ryan poured into me. I think what is most impressive about working with Ryan is that the advice he gives tends to sort of pour out of people once they get to know them. Since working with him I have now mentored multiple people from zero experience to landing their first job, it's so fulfilling that it is easy to see why he puts the energy he does into it!"

        <p>If you do what I teach and it's your second job, you'll have one in less than three months.</p>

        <p>This isn't a coding school or Bootcamp, so show up to this class able to code, and I'll take care of you getting your career in order.</p>

        <p><b>If you can't get a job within the times I said, I'll give you a refund.</b></p>
