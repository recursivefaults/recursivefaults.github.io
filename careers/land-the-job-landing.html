    <h2 class="major">How I got interviews EVERY time I applied without experience</h2>
    <p>When I got out of school, it seemed impossible to get a job. What's worse is that it seemed like everyone else could! It made me really question if I was cut out for software development.</p>

    <p>Every posting seemed to want 5 years of experience. I felt trapped in a Catch-22. How was I going to get the experience to show I had experienced? To make it worse, every posting wanted a bunch of skills that I didn't have, or rather, didn't have much of.</p>

    <p>Even after finding a few places to apply, it felt hopelessly random if I'd get an interview. When I did, the interviews were brutal, with lots of trick questions and impossible to solve problems.</p>

    <p><b>It was soul-crushing!</b></p>

    <p>I read the book "What Color is Your Parachute," and it changed my perspective. I realized that I wasn't getting interviews because my resume wasn't earning them for me.</p>

    <p>Over the next few months, I scienced the heck out of my resume and began testing multiple iterations and recording the results. At the end of three months, I could get an interview <b>every time I applied</b>.</p>

    <p>Some of the key things I figured out were re-arranging my keywords so they were easy to match. I also learned how to frame my non-development experience so that people couldn't help but call me. I also saw that people kept asking about the few same things in my resume, which meant I knew at least a few things that they would ask me instead of some ridiculous question.</p>

    <p>With more interviews coming in, I continued to analyze my approach through the interviews and got my first offer.</p>

    <p>That process started over 10 years ago for me, and I've been refining it ever since and teaching it to everyone from first-time developers to Directors of Engineering.</p>

    <p>What I tell everyone, is that <b>the skills and knowledge it takes to get a job have nothing to do with your ability to do the job.</b> I hope you find some relief in that. It means that by acquiring a few more skills, you can get any job you want.</p>

    <p>Lets fast forward. I've been job-hopping for a decade now. Sometimes I changed jobs twice a year. Along the way, my fellow developers began to ask me how I negotiated pay since they hadn't done it or asked how it is I keep changing jobs and retain my sanity. Like all things, it took someone saying, "Hey, you should do this professionally," for me to realize that something I figured out for my career would help others.</p>

    <p>But I didn't listen.</p>

    <p>It took someone coming to me and asking specifically to help them get a job. That led to another peson, and another, and so on.</p>

    <p>Within just a short while, I had helped developers with negotiation and compensation <b>exceeding a million dollars.</b></p>

    <p>I'm getting a little ahead of myself though. You see, even though I started coaching developers, I didn't explain why. After all,
    I had a full time job already! I started helping developers and people in tech because I have some problems with our industry.</p>

    <p>The first one is that the whole process almost every company employs to hire people is built to weed people out of the job instead
    of finding great people. I can't stand the idea of skilled developers struggling to get a job. My heart breaks hearing how depressed
    people get when they think about having to start applying. Every developer I teach has freedom and power in their career. They are able
    to see that they can navigate even the worst process, get an offer and negotiate.</p>

    <p>The second problem I have is how companies treat people after they have a job. I don't want to spend too long on this because I
    can go on and on. Instead I'll ask this question. How has your job contributed to your life goals? Too many times I see people feel
    like their job and their life are separate compartments. While you may conduct yourself differently in each, there is so much more! Why
    can't every job we take have a significant improvement on our life and lifestyle? My second problem is that too many companies have
    no idea and no interest in those things, and some will go further to cause trauma to their employees. I want people in tech to have
    endless opportunities to further their lives through their careers. I don't want them to feel trapped or helpless by it.</p>

    <p>So why did I start coaching people? Knowing you can leave a job and get another allows you to see each job as one that gets
    you closer to the life you want. If every developer learned this stuff, our industry would fundamentally change. Every developer I coach forces companies to re-evaluate how they hire and treat employees because the developers I teach can have another job whenever they want. </p>
    <p>I want to reach as many developers as I can. I wrote a book with everything I knew. I developed new techniques along the way. Finally,
    after a lot of encouragement, I made this class. It is everything I know, and my clients have discovered that works repeatedly.</p>

    <p><b>This is how to get the career you want for the lifestyle you deserve.</b></p>

<section id="materials">
    <h2 class="major">Proven Material That Gets Results</h2>
    <p>Okay, so the self paced-class is {{page.price}}, and that probably comes with a bit of sticker shock. If you put what I teach
    into action, not only will you get a job faster, but you can negotiate $10,000. That is a 10:1 return on only what I teach to negotiate.
    If you consider more broadly that this material will help you throughout your career, this material is worth millions in the career
    that you can have.</p>

    <p>Yeah, yeah, so what do you actually get? Let me explain the overall course structure. The class is 31 focused videos spread across 20 lessons.
    Let me break down the material:</p>

    <h3>Introduction & Onboarding - 3 Lessons</h3>
    <p>These lessons orient you to the course and prepare you to make the most of its material. You also will develop personal goals for both
    your life and career, and get a better sense of who you really want to be in that career. These elements will give you a clear direction
    in your job search, interviews, and negotiation.</p>

    <h3>Six-Figure Resume - 4 Lessons</h3>
    <p>I know nobody really loves dealing with their resume, but it is required for every job we want. When you're done with these
    lessons you'll have a resume that will have a dramatic increase in the number of interviews you get.</p>

    <h3>Other Materials &amp; Applying to Jobs - 5 Lessons</h3>
    <p>Some of you are already thinking, "What about my portfolio site or github?" These lessons will tell you how to get the most out of
    these other materials so that you don't waste a bunch of precious time. This lesson also introduces the overall system I teach people
    to use to get a job quickly. For first-time people, you can have a job in less than six months. For people with six months of experience or more, you
    can get a job in less than three months. 

    <p>The shortest time I've seen is two weeks. <b>Can you beat that?</b></p>

    <h3>Nailing Interviews - 7 lessons</h3>
    <p>Okay, this is the big one. These lessons break down the overall process that interviews fall into, introduce strategies that work across all of them, and then tear down specific interviews and how to deal with them.</p>

    <p>For example, everyone will get hit with a question they don't know the answer two, but I teach three different ways to handle that. When you have to
    do an assignment, I'll teach you how to do it so that you stand out from everyone else, and a few other secrets.</p>

    <p>The list goes on, but I want to be clear. I do not teach you how to code, or the answers to questions like, "How do you explain prototypical inheritance in javascript?"
    I teach you how to beat these interviews <b>regardless</b> of what they ask you.</p>

    <h3>Offers and Negotiation - 4 lessons</h3>
    <p>Here at the end, I teach you how to safely negotiate every offer you're going to see and a few higher-risk ways to negotiate as well. You'll also learn what is in your offer packet, what to ask about, and what to watch out for. Finally, I'll teach you how to handle a job search when you're already employed. At the end of this lesson, you'll be ready to sign the offer you want.</p>

    <p>If you do what I teach and it's your second job, you'll have one in less than three months.</p>

    <p>This isn't a coding school or Bootcamp, so show up to this class able to code, and I'll take care of you getting your career in order.</p>

    <p><b>If you can't get a job within the times I said, I'll give you a refund.</b></p>
