            <h2 class="major">Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>When you apply for a job, first impressions matter. Employers look at your resume and decide in
            60-90 seconds if they'll give you more time or throw your application in the trash.</p>

            <p><b>You need a resume that makes them want to talk to you every single time.</b></p>

            <p>Every time you get an offer you can negotiate at least $10,000 extra. If you have 5 jobs in your career, that is $50,000 extra you can make.</p>

            <p><b>You need a resume that shows companies why you're worth it.</b></p>

            <h2 class="major">My Story</h2>
            <p>When I started my career I started with a resume full of things like: Teaching English, Bartending, and Lifeguarding. <b>Not one bit of development to show.</b></p>

            <p>It was <b>soul-crushing</b> sending so many applications and hearing nothing.</p>
            
            <p>I got focused on my whole approach to applying to jobs. I built a system that slowly but steadily got me more
            and more interviews to the point that I was getting a call every time I applied.</p>

            <p>Within six months <b>I had my first job!</b></p>
            
            <p>Two more interesting things happened as I bounced from job to job. A friend told me to think about my job as a way to <b>get the lifestyle I want</b>. A manager told me that every time I skip negotiating I leave <b>money on the table.</b></p>

            <p>I incorporated these two pieces into my approach to taking jobs. Within three years I tripled my salary. Now I have my own business where I make almost 10x what I started making, and <b>I negotiated at least $10,000 at each job</b> along the way.</p>

            <p>A few years ago I wondered if others could do what I do. My very first student said this:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "3 months ago I landed a dream job working on a product that I had already used and loved for the better part of a decade with a salary that I would have laughed at if you told me five years ago. It would be an understatement to say that I worked hard for all of this, but it is also completely true that none of this would have been possible without the ways that Ryan poured into me."
            </blockquote>
