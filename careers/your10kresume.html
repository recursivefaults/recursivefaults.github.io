            <p>When you apply for a job, first impressions matter. Employers look at your resume and decide in
            60-90 seconds if they'll give you more time or throw your application in the trash.</p>

            <p><b>You need a resume that makes them want to talk to you every single time.</b></p>

            <p>Every time you get an offer you can negotiate at least $10,000 extra. If you have 5 jobs in your career, thats $50,000 extra you can make.</p>

            <p><b>You need a resume that shows companies why you're worth it.</b></p>
