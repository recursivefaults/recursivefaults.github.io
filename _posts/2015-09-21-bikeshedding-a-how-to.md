Everyone I work with and know has a grand idea for a business or product. I like to ask them lots of questions about
their idea to see how much they've thought through. It seems most people have constructed a fairly detailed fantasy
about their idea being wildly successful.

Every detail they tell me, from the most vague and abstract to the most specific is an assumption in their fantasy. If
I were to help advise them on how to actually tackle this list of assumptions, they would push back because I would 
identify the one assumption that if proved false, destroys their business, and come up with a plan to run as fast as we
can into that possibility. This is not something people enjoy.

Lets say, for a minute though, that you are someone who is willing to let their idea evolve completely and totally into
an actual business that is used and adored by customers. What you're left with is trying to come up with experiments
that are fast and significant enough for you to make a judgment on your hypotheses without bias. This is not something
people can just do. It actually takes practice.

I want to offer some ideas for practice, and one came to me recently that I though of sharing. There are plenty of people
who now about the [bike shed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality) problem, and it's one that
plagues groups of people all the time. Basically it boils down to the idea that the more relatable the problem or topic
becomes, the more people will speak into it. This is problematic, because the more trivial the problem or topic is, the
more likely it will be that people find it relatable. Here is my suggestion on how to practice experimenting.

Don't start with a big assumption that is hard to relate to. Pick one that is trivial or relatable, one that you can see
all the details of. One that makes sense to you. You will have a list of variables that you know you can account for. 
An example would be making coffee. You know that the tool, temperature, bean quality, and water all play significant factors
into making a great cup of coffee. Make an experiment that addresses only one, while you control for the others. Make
the best cup of coffee you can. If that isn't good, how about putting your laundry away in your dresser. You know that
there are some clothes you prefer to wear often, some you don't, some drawers are organized differently than others.
Conduct an experiment where you can maximize the storage and effectiveness of storing your clothing. You can account
for all of the variability there. You can do this for you home pantry, your kitchen drawers, how you organize your desktop
icons (If you do at all).

The point is, leverage your natural proclivity to focus on trivial details to practice experimentation. Then you'll be
much better equipped to tackle those bigger, harder to rationalize assumptions that will prevent your business from
succeeding or not.
