This week I wanted to write about a technique that I use pretty regularly. The Pomodoro Technique. While I suspect many of you are familiar with it, I want to go over the basics so that if you want to find a way to make the most of the time you have, you can get started.

I’ll also write a longer guide [on my blog](https://ryanlatta.com/consulting/2020/04/02/getting-started-with-pomodoro.html).

The basic concept is that you want to start a timer for 24 minutes and focus on only one thing with 100% of your effort for those 24 minutes. Then you take a small 4 minute break, and repeat. You do this cycle 4 times and then take a longer break.

The trick with this technique isn’t in its short timings or rigid timings. The trick is in the 100% effort while your timer is running.

Most of us have have learned to live in a state of constant distraction. Emails, phone calls, a conversation, and wandering thoughts are the most common culprits of our focus. When you start with this technique pay attention to how long you go before you lose your focus.

It will likely be less than five minutes.

That is how I started and the person who created the technique did as well. It turns out we have to train our focus and attention and this technique helps. By the time you get up to 24 minutes of solid focus, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish.
