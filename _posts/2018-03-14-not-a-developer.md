I have been interviewing recently, and today an interview that I have had so many times before.

"Tell me about your technical background?"

"Well, I've been writing code professionally for about 10 years but..."

"Perfect, we have a technical position!"

This paraphrases every interview I've had for the past 4 years or so. I know how and why this happens, but I will not
abide this. This happens because I have technical experience and skills that are in high demand. I get that. I am not
a particularly talented or gifted developer, but people who have worked with me will hire me again without hesitation.

I will not code for you.

The part missing from the paraphrase above is where I tell people that I believe writing a line of code is the least
responsible thing I can do.

The least responsible thing I can do is write a line of code.

If that is frustrating, how many times have you removed a feature from a product? By remove I mean get rid of the code
behind it.

The answer is probably never. That is because what most of us, as developers, do is is believe in a vision that is rarely
a reality and is based on adding more and more features to a product that has a fraction of the value we are investing
in.

I reject this as a reality.

I write code for you and that code is part of a unit. That unit may be a feature or a part of one. That unit now must
be maintained as a cost. In part to adjust it with new features, but also with new bugs. Lets also remember the part
where everyone has to learn my code as a part of their daily work so they can add other stuff unrelated to mine.

Does this cost pale in comparison to the value?

I will not code for you.

You'll find all over the internet stories of developers talking about leaving them to code. You'll find some saying why
that is. Its because when we can no longer believe in doing something that matters, we can hedge our bets on doing
something well.

See, we are sold visions for the product. The value it brings and the problems it solves. We believe in this vision.
This becomes our purpose. More often than not this vision and purpose does not reach any kind of fulfillment and feels
like a feature shop like the one before. So we have a few choices. Do we fix the underlying problem of building things
that don't matter, or writing code as well as we can? The first of these we can rarely control or influence, but the
second one we can.

This results in highly skilled developers writing excellent code that will not be executed. We say hone our craft to
build the highest quality we can because *that is what we control* and the rest isn't on us. So we build feature after
feature that nobody wants in increasingly high quality.

I will not code for you.

Coding for you is not responsible. Fixing the problems around teams that have come to believe this is what I can do.
I can change the world for you and yours. Or, you know, write some damn code.
