                          <h3>Coaching and Mentoring</h3>
                          <p>Software creates change. Change in your users, and change in your organization. Having a coach or mentor guide you through this can be invaluable. Unfortunately there are no silver bullets.<br/>
                          I'll work closely with your organization in various areas:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Education and workshops with senior leaderships on software as an industry, and the various practices in use.</li>
                              <li>Turning a marginally successful or failed software product around with validated learning</li>
                              <li>Interviewing potential new hires to help with future software</li>
                              <li>Building a high performing software team for the first time</li>
                              <li>Implementing Agile or Lean practices</li>
                          </ul>
