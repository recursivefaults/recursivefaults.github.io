    Building software is hard. Actually getting results can seem impossible.
    I am interested in exploring what it takes to delivering software that
    has meaningful impact for customers, users, and businesses. I bring lean
    and agile tools and thinking to groups and teams so they can find a way
    to continually improve and relentlessly pursue meaningful results.
