Those first few days of a new job are full of excitement, nerves, and dreams of the future. As the onboarding comes to a close, millions of questions remain about how to start doing valuable work. This moment where the onboarding ends and work begins is often a bit overwhelming, and even more so for developers early in their career.

# Imposter Syndrome

Ever feel like you’re a fraud and that sooner or later, everyone will find out? That’s imposter syndrome. People feel this throughout their career. I still feel it after a decade. For people new to the field, it can create incredible levels of anxiety and doubt. If only we were as good as those other developers! When faced with those feelings, what do you do? What plan do you put into action to stop feeling like a fraud?

# Catching Up

Almost every developer I’ve met, including myself, feels like we need to catch up. We have to learn the technologies, the code base, the social norms, and a million other details before we can be productive. We don’t know where to look in the codebase to start. We don’t know what kind of design of the system exists to know how we should build. What standards should we follow? What’s the process the team uses for code reviews and sharing code?

The way most developers catch up is almost the same way they tried to learn. This approach typically involves trying to read every bit of documentation that exists. Suddenly they are looking at tutorials, reading the documentation on Redux, or internal Wiki documents. They are trying desperately to consume all the material they can. They believe that if they knew all of this information, they wouldn’t be so far behind.

Except that it doesn’t really work out that way. At some point, they have to stop reading and start developing. In all the unknowns, the developer writes their first line.

# Burning Out

With the pressure to finish work items, and keep up with peers, developers begin to work nights and weekends. They try to read all the material they don’t think they can while at work. They try to do side projects to get better. They try to work late into the night to keep up with the voice in their head that they should be better.

Exhaustion begins to set in.

How long can someone keep up this round-the-clock pace of feeling like the invisible devil of inadequacy chases you? Everyone has limits, and when this is the way we work, there isn’t a finish line. There is always someone who does something better, knows more, makes things look effortless. We can never keep up, and so we burn out.

How do you know burn out is setting in? Well, it shows up lots of ways for lots of people, but here are some signs to watch for:
- Loss of appetite
- Major weight fluctuations
- Short temper
- Fitful sleeping
- Nightmares
- A daily feeling of hopelessness
- Increased chances of illness

Early in my career, I developed a rule for myself. When I started having nightmares about work, I quit. I noticed that by the time I was having nightmares about my job, something had gone so off the rails that staying would surely prolong my suffering.

You need to pay attention to what is happening to your body and soul if you experience imposter syndrome. Burnout can have effects that last years.

# How Do Others Handle It?

All those people you think have their act together deal with this as well. They go to new jobs, start new projects, deal with new technologies too. How do they cope with these moments?

Well, many of us still feel imposter syndrome, but we cope a little differently.

Developers early in their career believe they lack information and knowledge. Senior developers know they can never have enough information and knowledge and have to use a process to get through things.

That’s the difference. Early developers focus on information, and senior developers focus on the process.

How does this look? Well, a senior developer when encountering a new code base confronts the same problem as the junior. They need to quickly make sense of it so they can begin to make changes. A more seasoned developer may apply the following techniques:

- Matching existing design/architecture patterns
- Debugging to bisect functionality
- Executing tests
- Asking for help

Now some of the things in this list come with practice. But the different thing is that senior developers tend to close the gap of what they don’t know with a different process. Each one of the techniques I listed is more hands on to the codebase instead of hoping documentation matches. Pattern matching is a technique that comes with experience. When developed, a developer can see a new technology or a codebase and make very accurate inferences to how it works compared to similar patterns they’ve seen elsewhere. This technique allows them to focus on the exceptional elements instead of the common ones. Debugging requires firing up the application with the ability to interrupt it at key spots in the codebase. This technique lets them see what is happening instead of reading about it. Executing tests provides a very similar level of insight while also communicating the intended behavior. The last one is the one to bring attention to.

# Asking for Help

More seasoned developers have learned to sense when they are spinning their wheels and not making much progress. They also learned early on that there isn’t any reason to struggle alone. They’ll seek help within minutes of encountering a surprise. Someone in the company has the answer.

Getting up and asking them compared to combing documentation is faster, more effective, and longer-lasting. The developer asks a question about one part of the code today, and when they come by tomorrow, the context is already there. This means the answers get richer and more appropriate as the conversation continues.

So for everyone out there who feels like they have to catch up, ask for help! When you get stuck, set a timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, you stop struggling alone and ask for help. Someone already has the answer for you. This technique will save you days of struggle, protect you from burning out, help you get moving sooner, and you’ll see that all these paragons of productivity are still just people.
