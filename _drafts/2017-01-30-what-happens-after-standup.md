There is enough written about effective and more so ineffective stand-ups. This time I want to explore the idea of what
happens after a stand-up is over. 

Specifically, the moment stand-up ends, what happens right after. There are two styles I want to kind of dive into:
Parking-Lot, and Nothing.


### Parking-Lot/Dev Huddle
First up is the parking-lot or dev huddle. There may be other terms, but it's easy to spot because it is a fairly
formalized time that allows the team or a sub-set to have time set aside to continue a conversation after the stand-up
is over.

This can be a pretty great thing. A really good sign of a successful stand-up is excitement to dive into topics amongst
interested members of the team. We should all be so lucky to be a part of a stand-up that actually sparked that
magical, "C," word: Collaboration.

Then, a good parking-lot or huddle would be a purpose built container for those topics to be discussed and
collaboration to continue, maybe even with some solid facilitation. I say solid facilitation should be a part of it
because there may be many topics that need to be covered to varying degrees. Also, these discussions tend to have
multiple agendas that need to be addressed. To get the best of it, facilitation is probably going to help keep that
collaborative moment going well for all the interested parties.

What then, would make this kind of a bummer? Well, let's imagine a stand-up that doesn't have the spark. Then imagine a
formal time on your calendar for 30 more minutes to, "Deep-dive." Sounds great right? Imagine again that this time is
only for some people, and not for others. Or, imagine that lurking behind that last statement there is an connotation
of who is valuable and who isn't. Imagine it turns into a conversation where no insights are gathered, the conversation
meanders and rambles until some other calendar appointment comes up, and people leave less sure than they started?

### Nothing
