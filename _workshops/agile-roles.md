There is a lot of Scrum training out there, and a lot of it is great. What is often missing though is how to really
excel within a given role in Scrum.

If you're a Scrum Master, this will equip you with techniques for all of your events and coaching those around you.

If you're a Product Owner, this will help you develop your product management skills as well as working seemlessly with
a development team.

If you're a developer, you'll know how Scrum is supposed to help you and how to make that happen.
