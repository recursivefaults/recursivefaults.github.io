title: Agile Team Performance Essentials
---

A client gave me the challenge to make a team so good that nobody can argue with the results. That is my kind of crazy.
This workshop is built around what steps you can take with your teams to create a level of high-performance that is
hard to argue with.

This workshop isn't academic or theoretical, it involves practical steps that teams and groups can take in almost every
environment. We will cover how to quickly bootstrap a team with Scrum, adopting essential technical practices, working
with leadership, product management, and metrics.

Agile Team Performance Essentials will challenge your beliefs about performance, but enable better results. This
workshop is an easy way to get a feel for the 10x performance offering.
