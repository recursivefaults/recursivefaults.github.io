title: Scoping and Slicing
---

Product people have to answer a number of core questions like what are we going to keep in scope and what order should
we do it in?

This workshop is built around techniques to uncover scope, break it down, and prioritize it into achievable pieces.
Scoping and slicing is a key ingredient to product owner and product manager success. My approach to scoping and
slicing is to create clear measurable outcomes, systematically remove non-essentials, then slice in a way that yields
a product with minimum complexity, is easily scaled, and new features added when needed.
