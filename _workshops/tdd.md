title: Getting Started With Test-Driven Development
---

Test-Driven Development is widely regarded as a best-practice, yet almost nobody does it. In this workshop we will
explore how to get started with TDD (Test-Driven Development), its limitations, and how to assess if it is paying off.
This workshop is not theory, but involves hands on guided practice building an example project and analyzing the
results.
