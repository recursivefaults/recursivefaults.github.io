                <p>I've worked with clients all over the country to help get better results than they could have imagined. The feedback I hear most often is, "Working with you is the best experience of my career." </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Saving a $76 million contract </li>
                    <li> Releasing the newest initiative on time, on budget, and with no defects </li>
                    <li> Improving productivity of software teams up to 10x </li>
                    <li> Going from concept to market in 14 days </li>
